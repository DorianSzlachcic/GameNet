# GameNet
[GameNet](https://gamenet-225603244235.europe-north1.run.app/) is a web application, made for course in university. Application is inspired by Filmweb. On GameNet you can rate games (app doesn't use any API so games must be added manually by admin), read reviews and news.

For testing purpose I've created user with all permissions, so you can try every activity:
Username: radnow
